# time-tracking-app

> a simple app to track time

This is a work in progress. Following along as I figure out how to build it at [erickmerchant.com](http://erickmerchant.com).

## Run

### Dev

```
$ npm run watch
```

Runs it and watches for changes, but not to index.js.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
